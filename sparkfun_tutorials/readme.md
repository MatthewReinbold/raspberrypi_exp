#Sparkfun Tutorials 

Sparkfun electronics has a great set of YouTube tutorials for getting started with building code and circuits for the Raspberry Pi. Easily approachable and carefully explained, they are a great starting point to building things with the credit-card sized computer

- [Part 1: Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6h95jNWg1g): Provides back story on the Pi, covers installing an OS, and ends with writing a simple Python script on an equally simple LED circuit.
- [Part 2: Wifi, Python, and Twitter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6HeRyrr4i9k): Quickly ramps up the interest factor by having Python connect to the Twitter API.
- [Part 3: Tweeting!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tEMRCtXALM): Who wouldn't want to have hardware sensors automatically posting to Twitter?
